
Lab Topic: Creating Virtual Machines From the course (Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure:Foundation)

-----
##Overview
In this lab, you will explore the Virtual Machine instance options and create several VMs with different characteristics.

##Objectives
In this lab, you explore the available options for VMs and see the differences between locations.

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create several standard VMs

Create advanced VMs. 

## Creating a virtual machine using gcloud command line

To create a virtual machine using gcloud command line, you will be needing Cloud Shell.
Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. 
Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.
it takes a few moments to provision and connect to the environment. When you are connected, you are already authenticated,
 and the project is set to your PROJECT_ID.
gcloud is a great command-line tool for Google Cloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion.

Step1:Sign into GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Console with the credentials provided by qwiklabs or using your account.
Step 2:Once you are inside GCP console, on the top right toolbar click the cloud shell icon to activate cloud shell. When prompted, click continue

Task 1:Create a new virtual machine instance
to list active account name, run the following command;

--gcloud auth list

To list the project ID, run the following command;

--gcloud config list project qwiklabs-gcp-02-15d80512ecad

To set the Region and Zone for the project, run the following command

gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c

gcloud config set compute/region us-central1

To create a new virtual machine instance in the Cloud shell run the following command;

gcloud compute instances create uloma-vm-1 --machine-type n1-standard-1 --zone us-central1-c --no-address

(Note: choose any unique name for your instance)

This above command after running will give you an output like this;

Created [...uloma-vm-1].
NAME        ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE  ...    STATUS
uloma-vm-1  us-central1-c  n1-standard-1 ...    RUNNING

To close the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

--exit

Task 2:Create a windows (Virtual Machine) VM:

To create a windows (Virtual Machine) VM:
to list active account name, run the following command;

--gcloud auth list

To list the project ID, run the following command;

--gcloud config list project qwiklabs-gcp-02-15d80512ecad

To set the Region and Zone for the project, run the following command

gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-c

gcloud config set compute/region us-central1

To create a new windows virtual machine instance in the Cloud shell run the following command;


Use the compute images list command to see a list of available Windows Server images:

--gcloud compute images list --project windows-cloud --no-standard-images

To determine whether an image supports Shielded VM features, run the following command, 

--gcloud compute images describe Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Core --project windows-cloud

Use the compute instances create command to create a new instance and specify the image family for one of the Windows Server public images.

gcloud compute instances create uloma-vm-2 \
    --image-project windows-cloud \
    --image-family Windows Server 2016 Datacenter Core \
    --machine-type n1-standard-2 \
    --boot-disk-size 100 \
    --boot-disk-type SSD persistent disk
    --tags http-server,https-server

The above command would create an instance running an n1-standard-2 machine type with SSD persistent disk of size of 100GB y 
   
where:

[INSTANCE_NAME] is the name for the new instance.
[IMAGE_FAMILY] is one of the public image families for Windows Server images.
[MACHINE_TYPE] is one of the available machine types.
[BOOT_DISK_SIZE] is the size of the boot disk in GB.Note that larger persistent disks have higher throughput.
[BOOT_DISK_TYPE] is the type of the boot disk for your instance. For example, pd-ssd.
  
 
To set password for the  windows VM created:

Use the gcloud compute reset-windows-password command to create a new account and password or reset the existing account password for the logged in user:

--gcloud compute reset-windows-password uloma-vm-2

You will be presented with a confirmation prompt; this will need to be accepted by entering Y and pressing Enter. 
It can be rejected by entering N, then pressing Enter.

This command creates an account and sets an initial password for the
user [username] if the account does not already exist.
If the account already exists, resetting the password can cause the
LOSS OF ENCRYPTED DATA secured with the current password, including
files and stored passwords.

For more information, see:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/operating-systems/windows#reset

-Would you like to set or reset the password for [username] (Y/n)?

Once confirmed, confirmation of password reset will look as follows.

Resetting and retrieving password for [username] on [instance-name]
Updated [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project-name/zones/zone/instances/instance-name].
ip_address: ip-address
password:   password
username:   username

You may now connect to the instance using the provided username and password combination.

To exit Cloud Shell, run the following command;

--exit

Task 3:Create a Custom VM

To create a Custom VM:

to list active account name, run the following command;

--gcloud auth list

To list the project ID, run the following command;

--gcloud config list project qwiklabs-gcp-02-15d80512ecad

To set the Region and Zone for the project, run the following command

--gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b

--gcloud config set compute/region us-west1

To create a new  custom VM instance in the Cloud shell run the following command;

--gcloud compute instances create uloma-vm-3 --custom-cpu 6 --custom-memory 32

 The above command would create an instance running an N1 machine type with 6 vCPUs and 32GB of total memory 
   
Note:The gcloud command for custom machine types differs slightly depending on the machine type family.


Note: it is advised to delete VM intances for provisioned labs.
To delete the custom VM above using the gcloud command-line tool, run the following command:

gcloud compute instances delete uloma-vm-3 --zone=us-central2-a

repeat same for all the VMs created above

To close cloud shell, run the following command;

--exit
