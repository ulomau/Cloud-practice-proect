#Lab topic:  :AK8S-05 Upgrading Kubernetes Engine Clusters. From the course--Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine-Workload
(Associate Cloud Engineer: Learning Phase 1 Main Track Channel 2020)

------

#Overview:
 
In this lab you will learn how to use gcloud command line to deploy and upgrade your GKE cluster
 

##Objectives:

Perform the following tasks.

Task 1: Deploy a (Google Kubernetes Engine) GKE cluster using gcloud Command line

Task 2: upgrade a GKE cluster using the gcloud command line.

#Task 1

1.Sign into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using qwiklabs credentials provided or through your account.

2. Once in GCP, in the tittle bar click on the cloud shell icon to activate  cloud shell. when prompted, click continue.

3. To list active account name run the following command:

--gcloud auth list

4.to set a default project ID , run the following command

--gcloud config set project [project-id]

Note:replace [project-id] above with the project ID provided in the lab

5. To set a default compute zone run the following command

--gcloud config set compute/zone [compute zone]
Note: Replace [compute zone] above with any zone of choice or the one provided in the lab

6. Deploy a GKE cluster by running the following command

--gcloud container clusters create [cluster-name]
Note: Replace [cluster-name] above with the unique name chosen for your cluster


#Task 2

1. To upgrade your cluster master's version, first run the following command to see the available versions 

--gcloud container get-server-config 

2.To upgrade from the default version to a specific version recent(highest)build, run the following command

--gcloud container clusters upgrade [cluster-name] \
  --master --cluster-version [cluster-version]

Note: replace [cluster-version] in the coomand above with the cluster version

3.To upgrade the node pool in your cluster, run the following command to upgrade your nodes to the version that your master is running on

--gcloud container clusters upgrade [cluster-name] \
  --node-pool=[node-pool-name]

4.To see a list of all running and completed operation in the cluster, run the following command

--gcloud beta container operations list

Note: it is advised to delete cluster for provisioned labs.
To delete a cluster using the gcloud command-line tool, run the following command:

gcloud container clusters delete [CLUSTER_NAME]

To close cloud shell, run the following command;

--exit
